Mojolicious::Plugin::AnyData
============================
This plugin for Mojolicious web-framework
provides access to DBD::AnyData instance
from mojolicious helper.
It gives you a way to load up your test
data directly from a memory or a config files,
not from database.

It works ONLY in development mode, so you
can use this plugin as a test data source,
without a database connection.
